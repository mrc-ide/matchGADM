Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Arran",
           family = "Hamlet",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "arran.hamlet14@imperial.ac.uk"),

Description: This package contains two main functions which both map from 
    one shapefile to another through matching the area. The resulting output 
    is a data frame of proportions from each admin unit in the old to the new.
    This can be used to convert population sizes from one map to another.
