Title: Matches Old Versions of Gadm Shapefiles to New Versions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Katy Gaythorpe, Arran Hamlet
Maintainer: Katy Gaythorpe <k.gaythorpe@imperial.ac.uk>
Description: This package takes a previous version of the gadm shapefile and creates 
    a database mapping old to new. It does this firstly by matching the longitude and
    latitude of the centroid; then it tries to match based on name and whether the 
    centroid of one lies in the polygon of another. Finally, if match_nearest is TRUE, 
    it matches the remaining entries to the nearest centroid.
